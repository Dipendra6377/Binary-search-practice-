Question:
Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.
Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.

ANS: 
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {   
        int l=0,r=arr.size(),m;
        while(l<r){
            m=(l+r)/2;
            if(arr[m]-(m+1)>=k){
//we are checking difference between mid element to its index+1.
//then check its difference with k if we got difference less then k.
//then we're sure that in left we'll not get ans so we skip it.
                r=m;
            }
            else l=m+1;
        }
        return l+k;
    }
